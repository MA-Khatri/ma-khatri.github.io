                    The goal of this project was to experiment with different lighting styles and materials
                    by hand-coding shaders that implement different lighting calculation techniques with adjustable
                    material properties. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scene consists of a number of different objects. In the foreground are a hand-coded cube 
                    and sphere along with a teapot and bunny which all slowly rotate. In the background are a series 
                    of animated connected assemblies featuring: a set of square pyramids rotating about each other
                    and a rotating together along the red track, a recursively drawn tree, and a "wagging" tail.
                    Finally, there is also a ground plane and set of world coordinate axes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use the WASD keys to control the camera's position and click and drag the mouse to orient
                    it. There are several drop down menus, sliders, and color-pickers that adjust various properties of
                    the scene.

                    Calculating distance in Astronomy is difficult and it gets even more difficult the farther things 
                    are. For objects close to us, we can use <a title="Parallax Wikipedia article" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax" target="_blank">parallax</a>
                    to measure distance. It is relatively simple geometric method for calculating distance and the GAIA satallite
                    pushes this method to its limit using the entire orbit of the Earth as its baseline. But even then, it is only 
                    reliable out to a few thousand light years. For distances much further, astronomers employ the <a title="Cosmic Distance Ladder Wikipedia article" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder" target="_blank">
                    cosmic distance ladder</a> which is a series of measurements that build on each other to measure further and 
                    further distances. One of the earlier rungs are Cepheid Variable stars which puslate with a measureable 
                    period-luminosity relationship. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to determine the period luminosity relationship for Cepheid Variable stars 
                    and then use that relationship to determine the distance to one of our closest galactic neighbors, the
                    Large Magellenic Cloud.
