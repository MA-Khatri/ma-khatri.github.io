                    Hello! My name is Mahebub Aalam Khatri but I go by MA. I am a senior at Northwestern University studying Computer Science
                    and Physics with a concentration in Astronomy. For most of my undergrad, I have been working with the Dahl Group on 
                    the camera system for the SBC. My other research interests include large scale simulation for astrophysics
                    as well as physics based simulation and light transport.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I draw a lot of inspiration from science communication channels like Veritasium, 3Blue1Brown, and PBS Space Time and
                    enjoy sharing and presenting on interesting topics like the physics behind active galactic nuclei, dark matter and its role
                    in galaxy formation, the nuances behind ray tracing, and creating custom caustic generating surfaces. I really enjoy
                    making the effort to make things easily understandable and sharing the excitement that learning can bring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not knee deep in a problem set or figuring out why my code is not working, I'm probably with the band playing
                    with the amazing people in the NUMB drumline. 
                    <!-- I have about 7 years of marching percussion experience and have had my turn
                    on pretty much every instrument in the drumline. -->
