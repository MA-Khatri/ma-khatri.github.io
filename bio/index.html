                    Hello! My name is Mahebub Aalam Khatri but I go by MA. I am a senior at Northwestern University studying Computer Science
                    and Physics with a concentration in Astronomy. For most of my undergrad, I have been working with the Dahl Group on 
                    the camera system for the SBC. My other research interests include large scale simulation for astrophysics
                    as well as physics based simulation and light transport.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I draw a lot of inspiration from science communication channels like Veritasium, 3Blue1Brown, and PBS Space Time and
                    love sharing and presenting on interesting STEM topics. I enjoy making the effort to make things easily understandable 
                    and sharing the excitement that learning can bring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of classes, one of my biggest hobbies is drumming. I recently completed my last year with the Northwestern
                    University Marching Band's drumline and want to shout out all the current members and alums who made it such an
                    amazing experience these past four years. (Check out the videos below to see a recording of our cadences and halftime show!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also enjoy going on trips to national parks and exploring cities. My family has made it a habit to take a trip
                    about every other year so I am familiar with a lot of the U.S. Check out some of the places I have visited below!
